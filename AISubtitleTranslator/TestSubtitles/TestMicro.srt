00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,000
We are living through strange days.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,800
Across Britain, Europe and America,

3
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,560
societies have become split
and polarised,

4
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:39,080
not just in politics,
but across the whole culture.

5
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:42,880
There is anger at the inequality
and the ever-growing corruption

6
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:45,200
and a widespread distrust
of the elites.

7
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,200
Yet, at the same time,
there is a paralysis,

8
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,520
a sense that no-one knows
how to escape from this.

9
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:59,280
Even in America, where there is now
hope with the new president,

10
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,520
there are also fears that,
despite the growing crisis,

11
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,760
the system will just return
to normal.

12
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:10,840
This paralysis is also fuelled
by a technology, driven by the aim

13
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,280
of giving you today another version
of what you had yesterday...

14
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,560
..and never a different tomorrow.

15
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:32,120
These films are a history
of how we got to this place
